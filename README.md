# React + Vite + TypeScript: Zero to Competence

A brutally honest, practice-driven curriculum designed to take you from "I know some JavaScript" to "I can build production-ready React applications."

This repository contains a structured learning path (Modules 0-9) and a comprehensive Interview Preparation suite. It is not a tutorial where you copy-paste code; it is a set of requirements, theory, and challenges that force you to build solutions yourself.

## 📚 Curriculum Modules

The core curriculum is divided into 10 modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of modern React development.

| Module | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Module 0](module0.html)** | **JS Prerequisites** | ES6+, Array Methods, Asynchronous Logic, and the "React Mental Model" (Reference vs. Value). |
| **[Module 1](module1.html)** | **Fundamentals** | Setup with Vite, JSX vs HTML, Components as Functions, and TypeScript Props. |
| **[Module 2](module2.html)** | **Hooks & Lifecycle** | Mastering `useState`, `useEffect`, and understanding the component lifecycle. |
| **[Module 3](module3.html)** | **Routing & API** | Client-side routing with React Router and fetching data from APIs. |
| **[Module 4](module4.html)** | **State & Forms** | Controlled components, form validation, and complex state management. |
| **[Module 5](module5.html)** | **Advanced Patterns** | Custom Hooks, `useReducer`, and Memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`). |
| **[Module 6](module6.html)** | **Global State** | Managing application-wide state with Context API, Redux Toolkit, or Zustand. |
| **[Module 7](module7.html)** | **Testing** | Unit testing with Jest/Vitest and React Testing Library. |
| **[Module 8](module8.html)** | **Pro Workflow** | Git strategies, CI/CD, linting, formatting, and project architecture. |
| **[Module 9](module9.html)** | **Perf & Security** | Code splitting (Lazy Loading), Virtualization, and preventing XSS attacks. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open `index.html`** in your browser to view the main curriculum dashboard.
3.  **Start with Module 0** if you need a JavaScript refresher, or jump to **Module 1** to begin React.
4.  **Do the work.** Read the requirements in each module file (e.g., `module1.html`) and implement the code in your own project.

## ⚠️ Expectations

*   **Pace:** Fast and aggressive.
*   **Difficulty:** You are expected to get stuck. Researching solutions is part of the process.
*   **Goal:** To build competence, not just copy code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **React** (Latest)
*   **TypeScript**
*   **Vite**
*   **Zustand** (for state management examples)
*   **Vitest / Jest** (for testing)
