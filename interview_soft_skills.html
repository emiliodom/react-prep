I deployed a feature that relied on a new API key but forgot to add the key to the production environment variables.

<span class="code-comment">// The Process Change</span>
I updated our deployment checklist and added a script that validates required env vars on server startup, crashing early if one is missing.

                <p><strong>Do:</strong> Communicate early. Prioritize features (MoSCoW method - Must have, Should have, Could have). Propose a scope cut (MVP) to meet the date with high quality, rather than shipping buggy code.</p>

                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> The number of people who would need to get hit by a bus for the project to stall. If it's 1, that's bad. I increase it by writing documentation, pair programming, and rotating responsibilities so knowledge is distributed."</p>
